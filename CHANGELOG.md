- (Retail) The Damage Meter can now sync more than just visibility now. For each Damage Meter window, the following will be synchronised:
  - Window Visibility
  - Window Size
  - Window Position
  - Which Information to show (Damage, healing etc.)
- Another attempt at fixing Zone Map Opacity Saving
- Added safeguards against trying to apply invalid values such as font size to Chat Frames
