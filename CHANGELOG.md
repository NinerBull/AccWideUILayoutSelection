- Added ability to sync Bag Organisation Settings.
  - This will sync Bag Assigments (e.g. Equipment, Consumables etc) and the Loot to Leftmost Bag and Sort Right-To-Left Settings.
  - This option is disabled by default but can be enabled anytime via the `/awi` options menu.
- Potential fix for ElvUI users, where chat windows in the docking panels would get shifted out of place upon logging in.
  - The addon will attempt to re-dock those chat windows after loading the Chat Settings.
- Potential fix for Lua Error with Raid Frames in Classic clients.
- Updated TOC for 11.2.0 and 3.4.5
