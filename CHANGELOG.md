- Increased time that Chat Window settings take to apply.

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- The following functions are disabled in Midnight due to them triggering secret-related errors:
  - Damage Meter's locked status, and what data to show.
  - Syncing Showing/Hiding Chat Channels per Chat Window.
- Any Damage Meter windows created by this addon that did not already exist on the character you logged into (e.g. a fresh character) will cause Taint errors when clicking a character to view more info.
  - This should not occur again after relogging into the same character, or typing `/reload` into the chat box, as long as you do not manually close and re-open the extra Damage Meter window(s).
