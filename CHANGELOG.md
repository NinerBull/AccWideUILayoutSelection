- Added new Midnight Specific Tab to the addon options, which allows you to manually save and load settings which can cause UI Taint in Midnight.
  - Currently Includes:
    - Damage Meter Size/Position/Meter Type
	- Chat Channel Visibility per Tab
- Removed 'spellActivationOverlayOpacity' CVar from sync, as it is now Account-Wide by default, which should prevent it resetting to 0.
  - Added a one-time script to check if 'spellActivationOverlayOpacity' is 0 upon loading after updating. If so, it'll reset to Default.
- Addon will now force-refresh tabs in the Chat Dock upon loading Settings.
