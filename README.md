An addon for World of Warcraft Dragonflight!

## About
This addon allows you to use the same UI Layout you've created in Edit Mode across all your characters and specs automatically, without needing to select it manually every time.

## Compatibility

## Installation
Download the latest version from one of the places below, and unzip it in your `<warcraft>\<_version_>\Interface\Addons` folder if installing manually.

To do this, simply install the addon, and your selected UI Layout is saved and will be used for all your chars! To change it, simply select another layout in Edit Mode.

## Configuration
You can configure the addon by typing `/accwideui` into chat.
