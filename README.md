# Account Wide UI Layout Selection

This addon allows you to use the same UI Layout you've created in Edit Mode across all your characters and specs automatically, without needing to select it manually every time.

To do this, simply install the addon, and your selected UI Layout is saved and will be used for all your chars! To change it, simply select another layout in Edit Mode.

You can configure the addon by typing `/accwideui` into chat.

<ul>
<li>You can toggle whether the Account Wide UI applies automatically to all new characters (or chars you haven't yet logged into after installing the addon).</li>
<li>You can toggle whether text is written into chat when the Addon sets your UI Layout.</li>
<li>You can toggle whether the Account Wide UI is used on any or all specs. You'll need to do this for every character.</li>
</ul>
