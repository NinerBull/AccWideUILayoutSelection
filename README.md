# Account Wide Edit Mode Layout

An addon for World of Warcraft Dragonflight!

## About
This addon allows you to automatically apply the same UI Layout you've created in Edit Mode across all your characters and specs, without needing to select it manually every time.
By default, it will also save your currently visible Action Bars and enable them account wide too!

## Compatibility
* **Dragonflight** - 10.1.5

## Installation
Download the latest version from one of the places below, and unzip it in your `<warcraft>\<_version_>\Interface\Addons` folder if installing manually.

* [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/account-wide-ui)
* [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26459-AccountWideUILayoutSelection.html)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/NinerBull/AccWideUILayoutSelection/releases/latest)
* Or put `https://github.com/NinerBull/AccWideUILayoutSelection` into your favourite Addon Manager


## Configuration
Your chosen Edit Mode Layout is saved as the Account Wide Layout automatically after exiting Edit Mode (unless you have disabled it for your spec as explained below).

You can configure the addon by typing `/accwideui` into chat.

* Toggle whether the Account Wide Layout applies automatically to all new characters (or chars you haven't yet logged into after installing the addon).
* Toggle whether your currently visible Action Bars are also applied to all of your characters.
* Toggle whether text is written into chat when the Addon sets your UI Layout.
* Toggle whether the Account Wide Layout is used on any or all specs. You'll need to do this for every character.
