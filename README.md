## About
This QOL addon synchronizes various Blizzard Interface Settings that are **normally character specific** and applies them to **all** of your characters on your account automatically, including brand new characters.

The addon can synchronise the following, and you can disable any that you'd rather keep character specific:

* Chosen Edit Mode Layout (Can also be disabled per spec)
* Visible Action Bars
* Nameplate Settings
* Party/Raid Frame Settings
* Arena Frame Settings
* Spell Overlay Settings
* Auto Loot Settings
* Action Targeting Settings
* Chat Window/Channel Settings
* Viewed Tutorial Tooltips
* Zone Map (Shift-M) Settings
* Cooldown Manager Visibility Setting
* Empower Tap/Hold Setting
* Mouseover Cast/Self Cast Settings
* Block Guild/Trade/Channel Invite Settings
* Bag Organisation Settings (Experimental)

### Additional Functionality
* Profile Support - Save and switch between multiple Interface configurations
* Force Leave/Join Blizzard Chat Channels - Never see Services spam on any character again, or perhaps always make them join Trade Chat?
* Screen Resolution Specific Settings - Useful for users who sync addon settings across multiple PCs, enable in Advanced Settings
* Custom CVar Support - Enter your own additional list of CVars to synchronise across characters, enable in Advanced Settings
