# Account Wide UI Layout Selection

This addon allows you to use a UI layout that you've created with the Edit Mode in World of Warcraft, and automatically apply it to all of your characters and specs, instead of having to manually select a UI layout for each one.

To do this, simply install the addon, and choose your Edit Mode UI in the Edit Mode. Your selected UI Layout is saved and will be used for all your chars!

You can configure the addon by typing `/accwideui` into chat.

<ul>
<li>You can toggle whether the Account Wide UI applies automatically to all new characters (or chars you haven't yet logged into after installing the addon).</li>
<li>You can toggle whether text is written into chat when the Addon sets your UI Layout.</li>
<li>You can toggle whether the Account Wide UI is used on any or all specs. You'll need to do this for every character.</li>
</ul>
