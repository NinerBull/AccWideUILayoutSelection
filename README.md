## About
This addon synchronizes various Interface Settings that are normally character specific across all of your characters on your account. 
It eliminates the need to configure the same settings on all of your characters, including any fresh characters you make, helping you to keep a consistent UI Account Wide.

By default, all of the settings below are synchronized, and you can disable any that you'd rather keep character specific:

* Chosen Edit Mode Layout (Can also be disabled per spec)
* Visible Action Bars
* Nameplate Settings
* Party/Raid Frame Settings
* Arena Frame Settings
* Spell Overlay Settings
* Auto Loot Settings
* Action Targeting Settings
* Chat Window/Channel Settings
* Viewed Tutorial Tooltips
* Block Guild/Trade/Channel Invite Settings
* Block General/Trade/Services/LocalDefense Chat Channels


## Compatibility
* **The War Within** - 11.0.7 & 11.1.0
* **Cataclysm Classic** - 4.4.1 & 4.4.2
* **Classic Era** - 1.15.5 & 1.15.6

## Configuration
NOTE: After installing for the first time, you should log into the character whose UI you have customized to your liking. You'll be prompted to save the settings from that character to begin with, and its settings and any changes you make on any character will synchronize Account Wide!

Settings are automatically saved upon log out, and automatically loaded upon logging in to a character.

You can configure the addon by typing `/awi` into chat.
