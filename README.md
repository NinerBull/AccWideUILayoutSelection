## Configuration
NOTE: After installation/upgrade, you should log into the character that you have customised the UI the most, so that the settings from that character are saved and will propagate Account Wide!

Your chosen Edit Mode Layout is saved as the Account Wide Layout automatically after exiting Edit Mode (unless you have disabled it for your spec).

You can configure the addon by typing `/accwideinterface` into chat.
